			<p class="t1">Chicken</p>
			<p class="p1">Everyone loves chicken. From the perfect roast to a soothing soup to crispy, crunchy fried chicken, it's hard for us to get enough of America's top bird. Other than being delicious in so many ways, it can be healthy and nutritious (one 3.5 oz serving of chicken breast meat is only 165 calories, with 31 g protein).</p>

			<p class="t2">Beef</p>
			<p class="p2">Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.</p>

			<p class="t3">Sushi</p>
			<p class="p3">Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce.</p>
